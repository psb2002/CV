        <b>BMI Monitor for children health:</b> <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        This is an app that helps in monitoring children's health by classifying them into different categories
        according to their BMIs(Like Normal Weight, Under Weight etc.,). As of now, I have created the Python file
        which calculates and classifies the student data accordingly.

        <b>My site is my online CV:</b> <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          It has been designed using HTML which is quite trending in the industry these days.
          People will get to know about me if they visit this website.
          It is a static blog-like website designed using HTML, CSS and bootstrap framework.
          As the whole world is digitalizing, the way forward is by creating websites for all our needs.
          This project is the first step for me achieving this goal.
